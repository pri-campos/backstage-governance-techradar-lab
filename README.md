# Backstage Tech Radar Lab

This repository is a laboratory for studying and experimenting with the Backstage Tech Radar plugin.

It contains Tech Radar data (JSON) structured according to Backstage community standards, with the goal of exploring:
- Tech Radar data modeling
- Governance and decision tracking
- Separation between platform implementation and technical decision content
- Integration patterns with Backstage (frontend + backend)

This repository is intentionally focused on **data and governance**, not on Backstage application code.
